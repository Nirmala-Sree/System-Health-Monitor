# System-Health-Monitor
The System Health Monitor is a Python-based utility designed to help track and maintain the performance of your system. This tool continuously monitors critical system resources such as CPU usage, memory usage, and disk space, ensuring that your system runs smoothly without any unexpected performance drops.

The script uses the power of Python’s psutil library to fetch real-time system metrics and logs the results into a well-organized log file (system_health.log). Whenever resource usage exceeds predefined thresholds, it provides instant alerts to the console while also recording warnings in the log file.

This project demonstrates efficient monitoring practices, emphasizing reliability, scalability, and ease of use. It’s perfect for both learning system resource management and implementing proactive system monitoring solutions.
